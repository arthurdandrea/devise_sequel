Sequel mapping to Devise

*experimental*

My setup:

- Rails 3
- Devise 1.1pre2
- Sequel 3.9.0


put this in my Rails lib/ directory (RAILS_ROOT/lib/devise/orm/sequel.rb).
then in the devise initializer file, i put in these 2 lines:

  config.orm = :sequel
  config.apply_schema = false

Let me know if you have any suggestions and/or questions. janechii at gmail

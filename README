Sequel mapping to Devise

*experimental*

My setup:

- Rails 3
- Devise 1.1.rc0
- Sequel 3.10.0


put this in your Rails lib/ directory (RAILS_ROOT/lib/devise/orm/sequel.rb).
then in the devise initializer file, put in these 2 lines:

  require 'devise/orm/sequel'
  config.apply_schema = false

THEN

I like to extend only the models I need for Devise:

--------
class User < Sequel::Model
  extend Devise::Models
  extend Devise::Orm::Sequel::Hook

  plugin :validation_class_methods
  plugin :hook_class_methods

  devise ... 
end
--------

But if you want them to be globally available for all your Sequal models, then uncomment the lines at the bottom of the sequel.rb filie.

Let me know if you have any suggestions and/or questions. janechii at gmail

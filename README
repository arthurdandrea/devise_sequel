Sequel mapping to Devise

*experimental*

My setup:

- Rails 3
- Devise 1.1.rc0
- Sequel 3.10.0


put this in your Rails lib/ directory (RAILS_ROOT/lib/devise/orm/sequel.rb).
then in the devise initializer file, put in these 2 lines:

  require 'devise/orm/sequel'
  config.apply_schema = false

Let me know if you have any suggestions and/or questions. janechii at gmail
